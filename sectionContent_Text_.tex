\section{Introduction}
In most vertebrates, cytotoxic T-cells enforce multi-cellular order by killing both infected and cancerous cells~\cite{Anderson_2004}. Each individual organism possesses a poly-clonal army of T-cells which collectively are able to distinguish rare unhealthy cells from healthy ones. This amazing feat is achieved through the winnowing and expansion of clonal T-cell populations possessing highly specific T-cell receptors (TCRs)~\cite{Blackman_1990}. Each distinct TCR is able to recognize a small number of similar peptides bound to an MHC molecule on the surface of a cell~\cite{Huseby_2005}. Though there are many steps in ``antigen processing''~\cite{Cresswell_2005} (the process by which protein fragments find themselves loaded onto membrane-bound MHCs), it has become apparent that MHC binding is the most restrictive step and consequently the most important sub-problem of predicting T-cell epitopes. 

Initial approaches to predicting MHC ligands focused on ``sequence motifs''\cite{Sette_1989}, which were quickly replaced by a variety of regularized linear models, which themselves are consistently outperformed by regularized linear models with interaction terms such as SMM~\cite{Peters_2003}. The inexorable march toward black box non-linear models reached its local maximum with the NetMHC family of predictors, which are a collection of related models that utilize ensembles of neural networks. Two of these predictors in particular, NetMHC~\cite{Lundegaard_2008} and NetMHCpan~\cite{Nielsen_2007}, have emerged as the preferred methods for computational prediction of MHC ligands across several areas of immunology, including virology~\cite{Lund_2011}, tumor immunology~\cite{Gubin_2015}, and autoimmunity~\cite{Abreu_2012}. 

The primary difference between NetMHC and NetMHCpan is that the former is an `allele-specific'' method which trains a separate predictor for each allele's binding dataset, whereas the latter is a ``pan-allele'' method whose inputs are vector encodings of both the peptide and a subset of MHC molecule's primary sequence. The conventional wisdom is that NetMHC performs better on alleles with thousands of samples, whereas NetMHCpan is superior for alleles with only hundreds of samples or fewer.
