Predicting the binding affinity between MHC proteins and small peptides is a key problem in computational immunology. State of the art performance is currently achieved by two predictors in the NetMHC family, both of which are large ensembles of neural networks. We introduce two new ideas which allow a single network to achieve competitive accuracy: learned vector embedding for amino acids and ``soft-pretraining'' on imputed binding affinities.  We implement these improvements in an  open-source software package called MHCFlurry, and show that MHCFlurry achieves state of the art performance.
