Predicting the binding affinity between MHC proteins and small peptides is a key problem in computational immunology. State of the art performance is currently achieved by the NetMHC family of predictors, which are large ensembles of artificial neural networks. We introduce two new ideas that enable a single artificial neural network to achieve competitive performance for this problem. First, instead of a one-hot encoding of amino acid residues, we use an input layer consisting of learned vector embeddings of amino acid residues. Second, we apply a soft pretraining step using an augmented training set based on a matrix completion of the original training data. We implement these improvements in an open-source software package called MHCFlurry, and show that MHCFlurry achieves state of the art performance.
