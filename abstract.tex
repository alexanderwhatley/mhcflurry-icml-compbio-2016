Predicting the binding affinity between MHC proteins their peptide ligands is a key problem in computational immunology. State of the art performance is currently achieved by the single allele predictor NetMHC and the pan-allele predictor netMHCpan, both of which are ensembles of neural networks. We explore an intermediate between single allele and pan-allelic prediction: an allele-specific predictor trained with data imputed from similar alleles. We find that the imputation strategy is useful on alleles with very little training data (under 100 examples). We implement this idea in an open-source software package called MHCflurry, and show that MHCflurry achieves competitive performance.
