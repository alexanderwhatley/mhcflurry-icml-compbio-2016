\subsection*{Datasets}
Two datasets were used from a recent paper studying the relationship between training data and pMHC predictor accuracy\cite{Kim_2014}. The training dataset (BD2009) contained entries from IEDB\cite{Salimi_2012} up to 2009 and the test dataset (BLIND) contained IEDB entries from between 2010 and 2013 which did not overlap with BD2009.
