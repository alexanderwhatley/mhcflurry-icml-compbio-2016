\section{Evaluating a predictor}

Throughout this paper we will evaluate a pMHC binding predictor using three different metrics:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf F$_1$ score}: Measures trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for predicting ``strong binders'' with affinities $<= 500$nM. 
\item {\bf AUC}: Area under the ROC curve. Estimates the probability that a ``strong binder'' peptide will be given a stronger predicted affinity than one whose ground truth affinity is $>500$nM. 
\item {\bf Kendall's $\tau$}: Rank correlation across the full spectrum of binding affinities.
\end{itemize}
