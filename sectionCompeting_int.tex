\section*{Evaluation}
Overview of dataset and comparison of NetMHC and all combinations of our models:
\begin{itemize}
\item one-hot vs. vector embedding encoding of amino acids (let size of embedding be picked separately for each allele during CV, or fix it? is one-hot best for alleles with little data -- maybe let this be picked as well?)
\item no dataset augmentation vs. hard augmentation vs. soft pretraining augmentation
\item any other minor things? number of hidden layers?
\end{itemize}
