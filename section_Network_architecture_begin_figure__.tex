\section{Predicting affinities for multiple peptide lengths using a 9mer encoding}
Reduction from multiple peptide lengths to a 9mer encoding was done using a scheme inspired by NetMHC\cite{lundegaard2008accurate}. Peptides with only 8 amino acids were extended with the insertion of a special wildcard ``X'' at every position in the sequence. Peptides longer than 9 amino acids were shortened by removing consecutive stretches of residues at every position. These lengthened or shortened samples were included in the training set with a sample weight inversely proportional to the number of samples created from a single measurement.
